# MergePDFs
This is a console application that merges pdfs preserving the bookmark structure of each individual pdf with name of each pdf being the chapter names of the generated file.

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2015+

### Usuage
   ```sh
   mergepdfs "path to the parent folder of the folder containing the pdfs"
   ```

### To-do
- For most use cases it would be helpful to modify the code to use the path to the folder containing the pdfs rather than the parent folder.  The current folder conventions used here were to fulfill specific user requests.
